  We present 2 practical approaches to fitting generalized linear models in a distributed framework.  The use case for this framework is where multiple sites (e.g. hospitals) have data with protected or private information that cannot be shared, but aggregated data can be, and each site can send aggregated data across the internet.  
  We present the first strategy: using synced folder services, such as Dropbox or Box Sync, to share the aggregated data.  The second strategy involves creating an application programming interface (API), where sites submit the data to this service.  This work relies on the R statistical software; we provide an R package of examples and code to create an API on DigitalOcean.

# Introduction
We introduce a distrbuted framework to analyze data from multiple sources with the data being properly siloed. The motivation for this problem is simple: we would like to fit a generalized linear model (GLM) on data from multiple sites (e.g. hospitals), where the indvidual patient-level data or otherwise private data never leaves the server (siloed), which is usually behind a firewall.  The idea is that a model is specified, and sent to each site where a summary statistic is computed and returned to the modeling service/site.  The model is then updated and, if necessary, the process is completed until the model is fit until convergence.  The goal is to fit the exact model as if the full data was accessible.  


The alternatives to this process is meta-analysis, one-step solutions, or remote analysis servers [@o2008remote;].  There are drawbacks to a meta-analysis approach in that the model and statistics must be specified and commonly the data is gathered **once** from each site.  Also, if sites present estimates from models with different predictors, it is unclear how meta-analysis adequately handles this variability.  The process below ensures that the same model, with the same predictors, is fit at each site.  Any updated analysis requires additional correspondence between the modeler and the site data analyst, which slows down the process of analysis and creates more hurdles.  

The work presented here is almost identical to Grid Binary LOgistic REgression (GLORE) [@glore], its Bayesian analog EXpectation Propagation LOgistic REgRession (EXPLORER) [@explorer], and  Secure Pooled Analysis acRoss K-sites (SPARK) [@spark].  A few of the differences are: GLORE and EXPLORER focus primarily on only logistic regression, SPARK works for all GLMs like the proposed method.  GLORE and SPARK are iterative requiring all sites to provide updates until the next estimate can be achieved, like the current method; EXPLORER is iterative but asynchronous so that sites can share updates without coordination.  SPARK additionally compute on encrypted data, which allows for higher security; EXPLORER uses random matrix implementations to increase security, but required inter-site communication.  Similarly, @wang2017efficient show an iterative method for regularized/sparse model fitting.  @jordan2019communication present a general framework by sending surrogate likelihood information in an iterative way, which generalizes over GLMs, and they examples of M-estimators, regularized/penalized models, and Bayesian models.  All previous solutions do not provide practical steps or tutorials to set up a system, however.

To alleviate the need for iterative processes, one-shot solutions have been presented.  For example, One-shot Distributed Algorithm to perform Logistic regressions (ODAL) [@duan2019odal] is a distributed estimation procedure for a logistic model. for a given $\beta$, compute gradients of a likelihood and use these computed gradients to inform the estimate of $\beta$, but only with one iteration.  They have shown to get close estimates to the "true model", which would be the model fit if all data was included.  The work is expanded upon in Robust-ODAL [@tong2020robust], where median gradients are estimated as opposed to mean gradients, to diminish the influence of heterogeneous site data.  Other methods have shown that efficient one-step estimators or averages perform well compared to an "oracle model" with the full data [@zhang2013communication; @battey2018distributed].
These methods provide great approximate solutions because 1) they are not iterative, 2) can be computed in a privacy-preserving way, 3) can be robust to outlying data, and 4) can be seen as likelihood updates. As a likelihood update, the same process can be done with all but one site, determining the robustness of the procedure in a sensitivity analysis. The downsides are that the solution is approximate and if another model is to be run, the whole process has to start again.  Thus, we believe a remote analysis server can be more general.
 
The work presented here is similar to that of @o2009regression as it has a remote analysis server, but with a main difference.  Practical implementations such as WebDISCO (web service for distributed Cox model learning) exist, but these rely on a third-party service (at this time the WebDISCO URL is a dead link) or a remote analysis server.  In @o2009regression and most remote analysis servers, a full dataset primarily exists.  That is, the full data is available to that server, but not those submitting the models.  

The most common federated learning architecture is Federated Averaging [@mcmahan2016communication], which uses stochastic gradient descent to combine neural network parameters from multiple devices into one platform. Many platforms have been developed for this type of federated learing, such as Federated Learning platform from Google for deep learning [@bonawitz2019towards], Content Object Repository Discovery and Registration/Resolution Architecture (CORDA), which website does not seem to be associated with the platform anymore).  @2017arXiv171207557G and https://comind.org/ provide code on how to set up clients and run a federated deep learning model, but we wish to focus on simpler GLMs in this work, but acknowledge similar inference could be reframed in work based on Tensorflow. @li2019federated provides an overview of federated learning

Moreover, some remote analysis servers may be complicated and costly to set up or have little to no instruction on how to set them up, save for the examples with code above.  We will present a system that does have the same constraints, as it will rely on a few scripts or spooling up on a server on a low-cost online service with one command.  


<!-- For almost any approach, the gradient or some reduced-dimensional summary is required to be aggregated together to get the estimate of $\beta$ at the full population level.  If we combine these models with models that require iterative fitting, such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), there needs to be a lot of communication and recomputation of summaries to get a final estimate.  These approaches work well in distributed computing systems (such as computing clusters or GPUs), but have a much higher likelihood for errors if human interaction is required at each iteration.  This human interaction is a common practice for most clinical data, which we wish to show a simple solution to create the distributed computing much simpler. -->

We are not experts in distributed/federated computing, but would like to show how this process is possible, overlooking obvious hurdles such as authentication, load balancing, network issues, debugging, and overall security on the server side.  That said, some of the previous methods and authors present solutions with a series of additional checks with privacy-preserving measures which can be implemented.  We argue that analysts already have this responsibility of security, but in a more informal way. In some of the applications above, such as some of the one-shot solutions, the model specification and updates are communicated by easy, likely unsecure methods such as email.  Thus, it would seem as though iterative methods can give exact solutions in a secure way, but the iterative process is burdensome, and one-shot solutions are user-friendly but potentially as insecure as the proposed method.  We wish to make the iterative process easy and user-friendly.

A large reason for the importance of usuability is that the statisticians and data analysts that will be running the models will likely be using a statistical language, usually either R or Python.  Though we will focus on R, the ideas here can be extended to other languages and systems [@RCORE].  We implemented a practical solution in an R package that allows researchers to practically implement this system with real data.  The solution can be done a number of ways; we implemented 1) code to deploy an API (application programming interface) on a remote server and 2) scripts to calculate the model if using a synced folder, backed by services such as Dropbox or Box Sync.  This practical solution solves the motivating problem, allowing us to fit many different types of models with little technical overhead while keeping protected health information (PHI) private.


# Methods

## Motivating Example

Let's estimate a GLM an outcome $Y$ on a set of covariates $X$, with a link function $G$.  Let there be $K$ hospitals, and $Y$ and $X$ are on the data on all hospitals $1, \dots, K$. 

$$
g(E[Y | X]) = X\beta = \eta
$$

Let us also say that we are interested in $p$ covariates, and $n_{k}$ is the total number of records at hospital $k$ and $n = \sum_{1}^{k} n_{k}$, is the number of rows of $Y$ and $X$, thus $Y$ is an $n\text{x}1$ vector and $X$ is a $n\text{x}p$ matrix.  To estimate $\beta$, we would use:
$$
(X'WX)^{-1} X'WY
$$

Since we don't have access to the full $X$, but rather a series of $X_{k}$, $k = 1, \dots, K$, we can use methods such as parallelized gradient descent approaches [@zinkevich2010parallelized; @mcdonald2009efficient] or approximate maximum-likelihood approaches [@duncan1980approximate].  We choose to use the Fisher scoring method outlined in @mcculloch2000generalized (page 42), such that:

$$
u_{i,k} = \sum W (y_{i,k} - \mu) \frac{d\eta}{d\mu}x_{i,k}
$$
where we will get $u_{k} = \sum_{i} u_{i, k}$ and 
$$
W^{-1} = \left(\frac{d\eta}{d\mu}\right)^2V
$$
where $V$ is the variance function for the GLM evaluated at $\mu$.  If we let $A_{k} = X_k'W_kX_k$ we can get $A = \sum_{k}A_{k}$, which is a $p\text{x}p$ matrix.  If we get $u_{k}$, which is a $p\times 1$ vector, then we can calculate $u = \sum_{k} u_{k}$ to get the necessary gradient $\nabla\beta$ by $A^{-1} u$.  To estimate the dispersion parameter $\phi$, we need the sample size for each site $n_{k}$ and the sum of squared residuals, which each are a scalar number.  Thus, for generalized linear models, we need only to pass a $p\times{p}$ matrix $A$ and $p\times{1}$ vector $u$, and 2 scalar values from each site. 


## Implementation

We provide the `distribglm` (https://github.com/muschellij2/distribglm) R package to perform the distributed learning models.  The functions provided wherein allow for the fitting of models in addition to 2 specific sets of examples: a `plumber` file and a set of examples files using a "synced folder".  

### Synced Folder Implementation
Example synced folders are Dropbox or Box Sync.  Outside of the R package, all sites would have access to a synced folder.  This folder will only contain information about the model specifications and the estimates above.  **No PHI would go in this folder**, as it is shared across sites and the main compute site, which may be a data-sharing site.  

The first step in the process is to set up the model (with the `setup_model` function), which requires the synced folder location, the generalized linear model formula, which exponential family (and link function) is to be fit, a model name, the identifiers for all the sites to use for this model, and an optional tolerance measure that defines when a model has converged. The site identifiers are necessary for bookkeeping as well as to notify the compute site when all sites have returned the updated statistics for aggregation and provides a notification to each site as to whether the process is waiting on other sites or the compute site.  

Once this function is run, the output file is synced across all sites and the compute site.  The data sites then run `estimate_model` at the same time and the compute site runs `compute_model`.  Again, as these updates are required to be synchronous, these have to be run at the same time.  We believe a simple conference call walking through each step is a practical example of when this would occur.  Each site must change the code to read in the data (from a different location than the synced folder) into R, provide the site name, and the location of the synced folder on their machine, as this may vary across sites/computers.  The data set will have its rows shuffled and the parameters estimated and only the parameter information will be sent.

Once finished, the model will be returned and saved.  At that point, all iterations could be deleted or archived. 

### Plumber Implementation 
`plumber` is an R package that creates APIs (Application programming interfaces) for and from R [@plumber].  Though there are many frameworks to create APIs, such as Node.js and Flask, we will focus on `plumber` for a number of reasons.  Overall, the API needs a computational backbone for this process to work.  As `plumber` is based in R, we know that the server will have this already installed.  The function `do_provision_glm_api` will provision a DigitalOcean (https://www.digitalocean.com/) "droplet", which is an instance of a running virtual machine on a server.  This will install R on the server, web services such as `nginx`, `plumber`, and all the necessary R packages to perform the distributed computing.

The process is similar as above, but the need for a "compute site" is now replaced by the API.  The additional parameter required is the URL to the API endpoint, which will be given to each site.  A modeler or someone to specify the model is still required, which would use `api_setup_model` with the same information as above.  The model then would make the same folder structure as in the synced folder implementation above.  The sites would then run `api_estimate_model`, which would pass in the data the same way, and send the same information as above, but again requiring the URL of the API to be passed in for both functions. Additional login information and API keys can be set up so that more formal authentication can be performed


```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Proposed Framework.  The modeler/analyst specifies a model, sends the model specification to an endpoint on each hospital API, a computation is run and returned to the analyst and aggregated (usually a gradient).  The model estimates are updated and the process repeats until the model converges.  "}

# Issues

Though the system may seem simple to describe, many obstacles exist.  Mainly opening any system that interacts with patient data or a database (even if it were a spreadsheet) is a potential security risk which most clinical centers will not allow.  Though this caution is warranted, it may be more secure than the alternative of sending estimates in other communication systems such as email.  Though emailing has the upside of a human ensuring only aggregate data is transferred, it drastically increases the potential for wrong computation.  For example, the `distriblm` package can have add checks on the data for missingness, quality, the sample size is equal to that of the previous iteration/model, and other issues, which may be done at varying levels at each institution.

If a user chooses the API solution, then a server is required, and though we provide an easy solution on DigitalOcean, many institutions choose to use their own systems, which may require an administrator to oversee it.  This administrator is usually trained in information systems or information technology, which is likely not part of the clinical team.  Thus, providing support or interaction from the clinical team to the technical personnel can be more costly than simply emailing estimates.  Lastly, many institutions and research groups would like a "handle" on what models are being fit with their data, and thus limits on the API need to be created, which may cause other issues or limitations on teh proposed framework.  

These downsides are vastly outweighed when the system gets repeated use.  Thus, fitting one model one time does not generally warrant the work needed to set up this framework.  One specific example is running the same model with different combinations of sites, allowing for a formal sensitivity analysis. 

Additional security requirements should like be enabled on such as platform, such as random sub-sampling of the data at each site, adding noise to the vectors and matrices passed so that the sum is the same but each individual site has distorted estimates,
